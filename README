This repository is an implementation of an algorithm for cell polarity based on the article:
https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/full/10.1091/mbc.E19-09-0549

The code is written and maintained by Calina Copos (c.copos@northeastern.edu).

To run the code, open MATLAB and enter the command:
>> HybridPoly

The code in its current state will generate an instance of Fig. 3 e--g. 
By changing the parameters, alpha and beta, and setting both of them to 0.2,
the code will generate an instance of Fig. 3 a--c.
